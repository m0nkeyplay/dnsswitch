# dnsswitch

Flip DNS server on OSX quickly.

* Set the local pihole address
* Set or keep outside dns address
* Make executable 
* Copy to a place in your PATH

### Why?
Using a local pihole for DNS I also need to flip it off sometimes.

The 10-12 clicks to get it done in the GUI is annoying, because I usually just need it for a few things.

This is set for WIFI and one DNS server.  Your needs may vary and please update as needed for that.

Enjoy
